Background: I am Shamil, born in Ethiopia in 2002, with a bachelor’s degree in computer science from Mekdela Amba University.
Languages and Skills: I’m fluent in Amharic, English, and Siltgna, and skilled in Oracle, MySQL, PHP, and full-stack development.
Career and Current Role: I work as a junior DBA at ZamZam Bank, focusing on Oracle Database 19c and Oracle WebLogic Server, and I aim to become a senior DBA within two years. My work includes patching, upgrades, troubleshooting (like OPatch issues), and managing backup/restore operations.
Technical Projects and Interests: I’ve developed several PHP projects, including an online cinema ticket booking system, a car rental system, and a student management system, and I’m working on a Dockerized PHP web app with MySQL. I’m configuring environment variables for Oracle OBIEE in Docker and looking to use a pre-built OBIEE Docker image.
Certifications and Learning Goals: I hold a Udacity certificate in Fundamental Programming and Android Development, and I’m focusing on strengthening my Oracle DBA skills—specifically in SQL, backup/recovery with RMAN, and working with RCU for Oracle BI.
